# Headless Docs Index (Current vs Legacy)

## CURRENT (Tonight)
- EngineerTick (Windows PowerShell) is the engineer loop that creates branches/commits and builds artifacts.
- WSL runner consumes jobs and produces result zips.
- Intel sidecar ingests result zips and emits explain/score artifacts: `Polish/Intel/anviloop_intel.py`.
- Scoreboard/headline is generated by: `Polish/Goals/scoreboard.py`.
- Nightly pattern: Sentinel once (FTL) + one concept goal (ARC) cycles.
- Outputs to check:
  - `C:\polish\queue\reports\engineer_tick_v1_*.md`
  - `C:\polish\queue\results\result_*.zip`
  - `C:\polish\queue\reports\intel\explain_*.json` and `questions_*.json`
  - `C:\polish\queue\reports\nightly_cycle_*.json` and `nightly_timeline.log`
  - Run analysis: `out/run_summary.json`, `out/polish_score_v0.json` inside result zips

## LEGACY / Reference
- These docs are still useful for background: scenarios, assets, WSL-only loops.
- They are not the nightly driver now (EngineerTick + queue + runner is).

## Golden Rules
- Disk gate: do not build if C: free < 40 GB.
- Retention cleanup after every cycle (queue, staging, inspect, worktrees).
- Single-variable rule: do not change scenario and code in the same cycle.
- Chain-of-custody: commit in artifact manifest must match result meta.
- VALID vs INVALID: do not tune behavior when evidence is INVALID (missing telemetry/invariants/oracle keys).
- Green-but-meaningless: progress scenarios must have BANK PASS or metric thresholds; smoke is not proof.
- Assets/.meta changes only in approved daytime asset batch; nightly agents only queue requests.
