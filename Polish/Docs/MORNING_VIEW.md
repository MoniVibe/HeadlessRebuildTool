   - Quick overview with per-job cards and NEXT actions.

2) `C:\polish\queue\reports\scoreboard.json`
   - Machine summary with validity counts, top invalid reasons, and top failing questions.

3) `C:\polish\queue\reports\intel\explain_<job_id>.json`
   - Per-job validity block, oracle question summary, and suggested fix/prevention.

4) `C:\Dev\unity_clean\headlessrebuildtool\Polish\Docs\ANVILOOP_RECURRING_ERRORS.md`
